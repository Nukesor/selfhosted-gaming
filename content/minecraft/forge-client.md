Running Minecraft with mods is awesome. \
This allows for a lot of quality of life improvements, such as maps, JEI and other stuff.

## Installation

This tutorial is written for the official `minecraft-launcher`.

1. Download the [Forge Installer](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).
2. Run the installer with `java -jar  forge-*-installer.jar --installServer`.
3. Select the `Install client` option in the GUI that pops up

## Get Mods

Forge is now installed and you can add your mods.
For instance, my currently installed minecraft folder is located in `~/.minecraft`.

1. Create the `.minecraft/mods` folder.
2. Download all of your mods. **Be careful that the mod is for the correct minecraft version.** Some mods also come with support for another mod loader. Be sure to pick the _Forge_ version.
3. Copy those mod files into the `.minecraft/mods` folder.

## Start Minecraft with Forge

1. Just start `minecraft-launcher`.
2. Select `Installations`
3. Select `forge` and `Play`

## How To Install Mods

1. Download the mod's `*.jar` file.
2. Copy the `*.jar` file to the `$GAME_DIR/mods/` directory
