# The Project

This Project is **open-source** on [Github](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming) and is supposed to act as an **archive** and a well of knowledge.

Looking for guides on how to set up a specific dedicated gaming server can be a real hassle.
The information you're looking for is are often spread among a variety of forums, Steam community posts, and blog posts.

Those infos are often outdated and forums, as well as blogs, go offline all the time.

That's why I decided to bring this project to live.
Let's keep it in one place, where everybody can contribute to it, where it's easy make a quick backup of **everything** and on a website that will most likely not go offline in the next 50+ years.


So, if you have some hidden knowledge on how to set up a specific game, please create an issue or pull request on the official [repository](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming).

It's very much appreciated an it'll most likely help many other desperate and annoyed game server operators out there.
