## Hello everyone!

This site aims to be a guide for setting up your own dedicated game servers.


This Project is **open-source** and is supposed to act as an **archive**.
Especially for old games, those guides are often located in forums or selfhosted websites that go offline and disappear all the time.

Let's keep it in one place, where everybody can contribute to it and make a quick backup.


In case you feel like there's any game missing, please create an issue or pull request on the official [repository](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming).
