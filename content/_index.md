## Hello everyone!

This site aims to be a guide for setting up your own dedicated game servers.
Just use the **navigation bar** or the **search** function to look for a specific game.

If you cannot find the game, think about [contributing](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming) to the project.


## Best practices

Whenever you're done with your server setup, check out the [best practices](/best-practices/).
There're examples for some best practices, that should spare you some headache and prevent you from some common mistakes!

These include:
- Terminal multplexer
- Game management scripts
- Managing your games via a service manager

## The Project

This project is **open-source** on [Github](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming).
The idea is to create an **archive** and a well of knowledge for self-hosted game servers.

Looking for hints on how to set up a specific dedicated gaming server can be a real hassle.
It sometimes feels as if you're digging through archives to find some arcane knowledge for summoning a terrible abomination. 
The information you're looking for is are often spread among a variety of forums, Steam community posts, and blog posts.

These posts are often outdated or vague. On top of this forums and blogs go offline all the time.

That's why I decided to start this project.
Let's keep everything we learned in one place.
A place where everybody can easily contribute to it, where it's easy make a quick backup of **everything** and on a website that will most likely not go offline in the next 50+ years.

So, if you have some hidden knowledge on how to set up a specific game, please create an issue or pull request on the official [repository](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming).

It's very much appreciated and it'll most likely help many other desperate and annoyed server operators out there.
