## Hello everyone!

This site aims to be a guide for setting up your own dedicated game servers.  
Each game has it's own site, containing a full installation guide and all files that we are allowed to publicly shared.

If there is no guide for your game here yet, please think about [contributing](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming) to the project.

## Best practices

Whenever you're done with your server setup, check out the [best practices](/best-practices/).
There're examples for some best practices, that should spare you some headache and prevent you from some common mistakes!

These include:
- [Terminal multplexer](/best-practices/#terminal-multiplexer)
- [Game management scripts](/best-practices/#helper-scripts)
- [Managing your games via a service manager](/best-practices/#service-files)

## The Project

This project is **open-source** on [Github](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming).  
The idea is to create an **archive** and a well of knowledge for self-hosted game servers.

Looking for hints on how to set up a specific dedicated gaming server can be a real hassle.  
It sometimes feels as if you're digging through archives to find some arcane knowledge for summoning a terrible abomination. 
The information you're looking for is are often spread amongst a variety of forums, Steam community posts, and blog posts.

These posts are often outdated or vague. On top of, this forums and blogs go offline all the time.

That's why I decided to start this project.
Let's keep everything we learned in one place.
A place where everybody can easily contribute to it, where it's easy make a quick backup of **everything** and on a website that will most likely not go offline in the next 50+ years.

So, if you have some hidden knowledge on how to set up a specific game, please create an issue or pull request on the official [repository](https://github.com/nukesor/selfhosted-gaming).

It's very much appreciated and it'll most likely help many other desperate and annoyed server operators out.
