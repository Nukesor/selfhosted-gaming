# Self-hosted Game Servers


This project is an attempt to create a singular database for all kinds of self-hosted gaming servers.

It's purpose is to:

1. Show you how to install, configure and run stuff.
2. Act as a consistent backup in an age of missing websites and disappearing gaming forums.
3. Enable others to easily contribute and add their own games.




# Setting up your own version of the website:

The project is build with the static site generator [zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola).

1. Install zola
2. Run `zola build`
3. Done
4. Just serve everything that's in the `public` folder.



For debugging purposes you can run `zola serve`, which starts a local server on `https://localhost:1111`
